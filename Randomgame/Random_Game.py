""""#Note: To write test cases for a script like this, you need to separate the logic from the user interaction. Right now, the code is tightly coupled with input() and print() which makes it hard to test.

âœ… Step-by-step to make it testable:
Extract the core logic into functions

Use parameters instead of input()

Return values instead of using print()

Mock input() and randint() during tests
